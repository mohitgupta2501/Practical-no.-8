### **Aim of the Experiment:**

To understand different software testing techniques and design test cases for the Ayurvedic Management System to verify its functionality and locate bugs.

---

### **Introduction:**

Software testing is a critical phase in the software development lifecycle used to ensure the application functions as expected. For the Ayurvedic Management System, which deals with health-related data and treatment workflows, accurate and reliable testing is crucial to deliver a bug-free and efficient platform.

---

### **Objectives:**

After completing this experiment, you will be able to:
- Learn about different techniques of testing software.
- Design unit test cases to verify the functionality and locate bugs, if any, in the Ayurvedic Management System.

---

### **Theory:**

---

#### **Software Testing:**
Software testing is the process of evaluating and verifying that a software product or application does what it is supposed to do.

---

#### **Verification and Validation:**
- **Verification**: Ensures the software meets specifications.
- **Validation**: Confirms the software fulfills user requirements.

---

#### **Standards for Software Test Documentation:**
Test documentation includes test plans, test cases, test scripts, and test data, which must follow standard templates and formats to ensure consistency and traceability.

---

#### **Testing Frameworks:**
Testing frameworks provide a structured approach to automate test scripts and validate application workflows. For example, JUnit (Java), PyTest (Python), and Selenium for web-based systems.

---

#### **Need for Software Testing:**
- To ensure quality and reliability
- To detect and fix bugs early
- To validate user functionality and usability
- To reduce failure risks in a real-time environment

---

#### **Test Cases and Test Suite:**
- **Test Case**: A set of conditions under which a tester will determine whether an application is working correctly.
- **Test Suite**: A collection of test cases to test a software program to show it has some specified set of behaviors.

---

### **Types of Software Testing Applied to the Ayurvedic Management System:**

1. **Unit Testing:**
   - Modules like login, register, add symptoms, suggest medicine, and billing are individually tested.

2. **Integration Testing:**
   - Ensures that modules such as patient registration, doctor recommendation, and medicine inventory integrate and work together properly.

3. **System Testing:**
   - Validates the complete Ayurvedic Management System by running end-to-end scenarios like patient registration to invoice generation.
